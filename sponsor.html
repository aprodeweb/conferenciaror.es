    <p>
    Conviced already for next year?
    <a href='mailto:team@conferenciaror.html' target='_blank'>drop us a line</a>.
    But if you are not, let us tell you why you should:
    </p>
    <p>
    Become a sponsor of a long established, well-known event of the Rails
    community.
    </p>
    <p>
    Dating back to 2006, <i>Conferencia Rails</i> has been a reference event
    for experienced and newcomers alike, a meeting place where the new
    techniques are discussed, best practices are brought up to date, and new
    tools are discovered.
    </p>
    <p>
    <b>Show that you care</b>, become known among those hard to find developers and
    tech investors.
    </p>
    <p>
    Ruby and Rails developers might be the ones building the core of your
    startup, or the target public of your services, but if they build stuff
    with Ruby or Rails, and they care, they will most probably <b>be here</b>.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
    Showcase your brand or product among early adopters and technology
    prescriptors
    </p>
    <p>This is yor chance to give back to the community, by helping to make a
    non-profit event <b>great</b>. What a nice reason to be known for!
    </p>
    <p>

    different, we are ready to hear your ideas.
